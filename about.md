## About Me

I am an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at the Università degli Studi di Catania, Italy, building upon a strong foundation from my Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering, which I completed with 110/110 Full Honors. My studies are concentrated on computational engineering, allowing me to develop deep expertise in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

## Technical Expertise and Achievements

I am proficient in using industry-standard software, including ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS Mechanical, and Creo Parametric. My programming skills include intermediate proficiency in Python and C#, complementing my analytical work. I hold multiple professional certifications from Ansys, Inc., including the Ansys Professional Certification: Getting Started with Ansys Fluent. My commitment to engineering excellence was recognized with the Best Thesis Award from the Order of Engineers of Catania for my thesis on CO2 Recovery.

## International Experience

I have sought out international exposure, participating in the Blended Intensive Programme (BIP) on "Positive Energy Districts" at Dalarna University in Sweden. There, I collaborated with a diverse team of European students to analyze strategies for creating sustainable, energy-positive districts.
